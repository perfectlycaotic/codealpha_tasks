CodeAlpha Certification Tasks Repository
This repository contains the completed tasks for the CodeAlpha certification program.

Tasks:
Titanic Classification:
Developed a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset using classification algorithms like Decision Trees or Random Forests. The task included preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Stock Prediction:
Created a machine learning or deep learning model to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The task involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using suitable time-series forecasting techniques.

Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression:
Built a linear regression model to predict a target variable from a set of independent variables. The task included data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
