# CodeAlpha Certification Tasks Repository
This repository contains the completed tasks for the CodeAlpha certification program.

## Tasks :
1. **Titanic Classification**:
    -Developed a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic dataset using classification algorithms like Decision Trees or Random Forests. The task included preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Stock Prediction**:
    -Created a machine learning or deep learning model to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The task involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using suitable time-series forecasting techniques.

3. **Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression**:
    -Built a linear regression model to predict a target variable from a set of independent variables. The task included data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
